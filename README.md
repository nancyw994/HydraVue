## For GreenHacks, Spring, 2025
## Topic: AI-Powered Smart Water Leak Detector for Factories
### Idea:
Build an AI-Driven water leak detection system that monitors water usage patterns and alerts factories if there's a leak or excessive usage.
### How It Works:
- Use historical factory water usage data to train an AI model that detects abnormal patterns (leaks, excessive use, inefficiencies).
- Display real-time analytics on a web dashboard and send SMS alerts when leaks are detected.
### Tech Stack:
- Frontend: React.js (for dashboard).
- Backend: Flask/Django (API).
- Machine Learning: SciKit-Learn (for anomaly detection).
- IoT (optional): Arduino water flow sensors.
### Demo Plan:
- Simulate a factory's normal vs. excessive water usage using a dataset.
- Show how the AI predicts leaks or inefficiencies and sends alerts.
- Bonus: If using IoT, attach a simple flow sensor to a pipe and trigger an alert when it leaks.
### Note:
```Real-Time``` AI-Powered water monitoring that industries can actually implement!
